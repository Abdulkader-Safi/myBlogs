# Where Should You Host Your App? Hosting Providers Compared

So… you built your app. It works. It’s cool. Now the big question—**where the heck should you host it?**

We get it. Hosting is no longer just about throwing code on a server. It’s about choosing the right setup, at the right cost, with the right performance for your users.

Let’s break it down.

---

### **🧠 First, Know the Types of Hosting**

Before comparing providers, let’s quickly go over the three main hosting types you’ll run into:

**1. Serverless**

- Code lives inside functions.
- Runs _only when triggered_.
- Great for scaling fast and saving on idle costs.
- Example use case: a monthly PDF report generator.

**2. Serverfull (a.k.a. traditional VM or container hosting)**

- Long-running servers that stay active.
- More predictable. Better for real-time apps or heavy processes.
- You pay for uptime, not usage.

**3. Edge**

- Like serverless, but runs closer to the user (think: CDN for functions).
- Super low latency.
- Limited APIs compared to full Node.js.

### **💡 Add These to Your Hosting Checklist**

Every provider might throw around features. Here’s what actually matters:

- **CI/CD**: Can you push code and auto-deploy?
- **CDN**: Is content served near your users?
- **Scaling**: Does it scale automatically? At what cost?
- **Cron Jobs**: Can you run scheduled tasks?
- **Preview Deployments**: Can teammates preview each pull request?
- **Billing Model**: Are you paying for runtime (serverless), compute time (CPU), or server size (VM)?
- **Analytics**: Do you get insights into traffic, function runs, or errors?

### **🔍 Hosting Providers Reviewed**

Let’s talk options. We’ll cover the good, the bad, and the opinionated takes from the Syntax crew.

---

#### **FlightControl**

- Built by the creator of Blitz.js.
- Think of it as a _Vercel-like control panel_ for your own AWS.
- You’re using **your** AWS account, not theirs.
- Uses CloudFormation and Nixpacks.
- Pricing is a percentage of what you spend on AWS AMS.

✅ Great for AWS power users who want ease

❌ Requires AWS knowledge to start

---

#### **Render**

- Serverfull hosting. Think: long-running Node apps.
- Good support for Redis, Postgres, workers, and cron jobs.
- CI/CD, deploy previews, and custom scaling.

✅ Great for Node apps

✅ Easy to set up and scale

❌ Slightly unstable during instance migrations (watch your node versions)

---

#### **Vercel**

- The go-to for Next.js and modern React apps.
- Mix of serverless (Lambda) and edge (Cloudflare Workers).
- Killer DX (developer experience), fast builds, and global CDN.

✅ Seamless Git integrations

✅ Fast, optimized builds

✅ Solid analytics

❌ $20 per team seat can get pricey

---

#### **Begin**

- Started as a serverless CI tool, now does full-stack with web components.
- Uses open standard ARC.
- Focused on AWS under the hood.

✅ Great for quick serverless endpoints

✅ Lightweight and fast

❌ Niche setup—might not be for everyone

---

#### **Heroku**

- Once the king. Now… kinda ghost town.
- Bought by Salesforce. Progress? Meh.
- Free tier gone. Downtime more common.

✅ Easy to get started (back in the day)

❌ Outdated features

❌ Not recommended for new projects

---

#### **DigitalOcean**

- Known for their $5 droplets (VPS servers).
- Full control with CLI and UI.
- Also has an App Platform (but… meh).

✅ Perfect if you want hands-on Linux access

✅ Good docs and community

❌ App platform can be buggy

❌ Requires DevOps knowledge

---

#### **Linode (now Akamai)**

- Similar to DigitalOcean.
- Fully rebranded under Akamai for edge services.
- Trusted and reliable VPS hosting.

✅ Longstanding reputation

✅ Powerful VPS management

❌ Less community buzz after rebrand

---

#### **Netlify**

- The OG of free static site hosting.
- CI/CD, preview URLs, and functions built in.
- Recently rebranded (yeah, the logo’s polarizing).

✅ Best for static sites and JAMstack

✅ Smooth developer experience

❌ Limited when you need full backend control

### **💸 Pricing Breakdown Cheat Sheet**

| **Provider**  | **Billing Model**  | **Free Tier?** | **Great For**                 |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| FlightControl | % of AWS usage     | No             | Full control on AWS           |
| Render        | Serverfull, per VM | Yes (limited)  | Node apps, backend services   |
| Vercel        | Serverless/Edge    | Yes (generous) | Next.js, frontend heavy apps  |
| Begin         | Serverless         | Yes            | Quick APIs, web components    |
| Heroku        | Per dyno (VM)      | No             | Legacy apps (not recommended) |
| DigitalOcean  | Per VPS            | No             | Custom setups, control freaks |
| Linode        | Per VPS            | No             | Infrastructure-heavy projects |
| Netlify       | Serverless/static  | Yes            | Static sites, frontend devs   |

### **🧠 TL;DR – So, Which Should You Pick?**

- **Beginner?** Go with **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
- **Building a full Node app?** Use **Render**.
- **Want full cloud power without AWS pain?** Try **FlightControl**.
- **Old-school Linux pro?** Stick with **DigitalOcean** or **Linode**.
- **Serverless-only?** Check **Begin** or **Cloudflare Workers**.
- **Avoid?** Sadly, **Heroku**.

Choose what fits your project _and_ your future plans. Because moving providers later? It’s not always fun.

Let your app live where it runs best.
