### I Just Built My First .NET Core MVC RSVP Platform — Here’s How It Went

I recently completed a fast-paced, high-pressure project: a full RSVP platform for a **national banking association** in the Middle East.

The catch? I had only **9 days** to learn the stack, build it, and deliver results.

Let’s break it down.

## 🏦 The Goal: Smart RSVP for a Formal Banking Event

Every year, a national **banking association** in the MENA region hosts a major corporate event.

This time, they wanted a digital RSVP platform — to know exactly **who’s coming, who canceled, and when**.

### Core requirements:

- Online RSVP form
- Real-time submission tracking
- Email confirmation with **QR code**
- Check-in system via QR scanning
- Analytics dashboard
- User and employee management

---

## 💻 The Tech Stack: Clean and Simple

I chose a lightweight, fast-moving stack that fits the project:

- **Backend**: .NET Core MVC
- **Frontend**: Razor Pages + Alpine.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Client-side infrastructure

No React, no Vue — just fast Razor rendering and Alpine for smooth interactivity.

---

## ⚡ The Timeline: 9 Days, No Extensions

I started on **July 8th, 2025**. It needed to be ready by **July 17th**.

This meant:

- Designing the data model
- Building frontend and backend logic
- Integrating email + QR code features
- Building a responsive admin dashboard
- Testing and refining in record time

---

## ✅ The Features I Delivered

Here’s what went live by the end of the sprint:

- **Dynamic RSVP Form**
  - Name, email, guest info
- **Dashboard**
  - Daily submissions
  - Submission timestamps
  - Total count, checked-in, and canceled stats
- **Email System**
  - Sends confirmation with QR code
- **User/Admin Panel**
  - Manage attendees, employees, and access levels

The **QR code scanner and check-in feature** is the only part still in progress.

## 🧠 What I Learned (Fast)

This was my **first real .NET Core MVC project**.

In university, I only built basic WinForms — so Razor Pages, Identity, and Entity Framework were all new.

Key takeaways:

- How to use **Identity** for authentication
- How to organize services and repositories
- Real-world MVC structure
- Fast problem solving under tight deadlines

If I could start again, I’d first study .NET Core structure before writing a line of code. It would’ve saved time.

## 📊 A Look at the Dashboard

Here’s a quick snapshot of the dashboard I built.

It shows:

- How many people RSVP’d
- Who canceled or checked in
- When submissions were made

| Dashboard                                                                            | Submisstion                                                                          |

Clean, informative, and optimized for mobile too.
