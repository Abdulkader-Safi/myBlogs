# FilamentPHP v4: The Best Laravel CMS Just Got Smarter

FilamentPHP v4 is here. Faster. Smarter. More powerful.

**Why it matters** for devs and content creators:

- Better performance means less wait time.
- Tailwind CSS v4 brings cleaner themes and faster builds.
- MFA adds security without complexity.
- Nested resources and client-side scripts cut boilerplate.
- Custom-data tables, rich editing, bulk actions—all built-in.

## What’s New in Filament v4

### 1. Blazing Fast Performance

Tables render 2–3× faster. Fewer Blade views. Less HTML. Your app feels snappy.

### 2. Tailwind CSS v4 & Dynamic Colors

Responsive, modern design system. Theming uses OKLCH color model — more accurate, more vivid.

### 3. Built-In Multi-Factor Authentication

Out-of-the-box support for TOTP (like Google Authenticator) and email codes. Extra security, zero fuss.

### 4. Nested Resources

URLs and breadcrumbs reflect resource hierarchy. Organize content like Lessons inside Courses with ease.

### 5. Rich New Form Fields

TipTap editor, sliders, code editor, table repeater—all new. TipTap supports custom blocks, merge tags, and private image uploads.

### 6. Client-Side JS Helpers & Partial Rendering

Cut the trips to the server. Use `hiddenJs()` and `afterStateUpdatedJs()` to hide or update UI instantly.  
Partial rendering updates just what changes.

### 7. Tables Backed by Custom Data

No Eloquent model? No problem. Use arrays or APIs. Tables still support search, sort, pagination, and actions.

### 8. Bulk Actions, Upgraded

Improve authorization per record. Notify users with success/failure counts grouped by reason. Backend chunking boosts speed.

### 9. Unified Actions Across UI

One namespace for all actions. One import. More reusability across tables, forms, and infolists.

### 10. Refined Docs & DX Improvements

More examples. Cross-references. Cleaner structure. Docs are easier to navigate.

### 11. Extra Developer Tools

Enums with IDE hints (like Heroicon), `FilamentTimezone`, ISO formatting, and form state retention when creating multiple records.

Developers on Reddit report:

> “Some plugins not ready yet—give authors time.”

## Why Filament v4 Wins for CMS Builders

Because building admin panels should be easy:

- **Fast development, fast performance** — UI-heavy pages now respond in a flash.
- **Fewer surprises** — Client-side JS, improved docs, and powerful form tools mean less debugging.
- **Modern, accessible UI** — With Tailwind v4, nested structure, better accessibility, and theming controls, interfaces look and work better.
- **Secure by default** — MFA baked in—no plugin, no hustle.

If you're building admin panels, dashboards, user portals—or even custom CMS features—Filament v4 lowers the friction dramatically.
