# Event Tracking on Your Website with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager

Want to know what people _actually_ do on your website?

Pageviews are useful—but they don’t tell the full story. Event tracking shows you how users interact with your site.

- Did they click the “Buy Now” button?
- Did they submit a form?
- Did they download your pricing PDF?

With **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**, you can track all of that—and more—_without touching your site’s code._

Let’s walk through how to do it—and what events are worth tracking.

---

## What Is Event Tracking?

Event tracking records actions users take on your site. These aren’t just pageviews or sessions—they’re _interactions_.

Each event can include:

- **Category** – Type of event (e.g. “Form”, “Video”, “Button”)
- **Action** – What the user did (e.g. “Submit”, “Play”, “Click”)
- **Label** – Context (e.g. “Newsletter Form”, “Home Page Video”)

And yes—it works in Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, or _anywhere else_ your audience is.

## Why Use Google Tag Manager?

Normally, you’d need to add JavaScript on every button, link, or form. That’s a pain. GTM simplifies everything.

Here’s why GTM is great:

- No dev required (once installed)
- One place to manage all your tracking
- Works with GA4, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Ads, etc.
- Easy to test, debug, and publish

Once GTM is on your site, you can track almost anything.

## What Events Should You Track?

Now the good stuff—what should you actually track?

Here’s a list of **high-value events** that give you better insights and help boost conversions.

### 1. Button Clicks

Track every important button on your site:

- “Sign Up”
- “Buy Now”
- “Contact Us”

You’ll know which buttons work and which ones don’t.

### 2. Form Submissions

Know when users fill out:

- Newsletter forms
- Quote requests
- Contact forms

Lead generation starts here.

### 3. Link Clicks

Track clicks to:

- Social media pages
- External links
- Affiliate products

This is especially useful for bloggers and digital marketers in the MENA region.

### 4. File Downloads

If you offer:

- PDF guides
- Whitepapers
- Pricing sheets

Track who’s actually downloading them.

### 5. Video Views

Measure engagement on:

- Product videos
- Testimonials
- Tutorials

You can track if someone clicked “Play”, watched 50%, or finished the video.

### 6. Scroll Depth

Track how far users scroll on key pages.

- Are they reading your content?
- Do they reach the pricing section?

This helps you optimize long pages.

### 7. Live Chat Interaction

If you use tools like Drift or Tidio, track when someone:

- Opens the chat
- Starts typing
- Sends a message

Useful for support teams and sales funnels.

## Tips for Clean Event Tracking

- Use **clear names**: Use lowercase and underscores. Like `form_submit`, `video_play`.
- Group related events: Use the same event name (`button_click`) and change the label.
- Track what matters: Don’t overdo it. Stick to business goals.

Event tracking helps you:

- Improve conversion rates
- Spot broken or ignored elements
