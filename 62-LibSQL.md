## What Is LibSQL?

LibSQL is a **cloud-native fork of SQLite**, developed by the team behind [Turso](https://turso.tech). It’s built to retain SQLite’s simplicity and speed, while adding modern features for **cloud, edge, and distributed applications**.

SQLite is well-known for being:

- Lightweight
- Zero-config
- Embedded and file-based

LibSQL keeps all that. But it goes further. It brings SQLite into the modern era, **where apps need sync, replication, and multi-region access**.

---

## Why Was LibSQL Created?

Let’s face it. The world changed.

- Apps now run on the **edge**, across multiple regions.
- Users expect **real-time sync** and offline support.
- Serverless is the new normal.
- Developers want **simplicity + scalability**.

SQLite was never built for that. But LibSQL is.

> “LibSQL is SQLite, supercharged for the cloud.”

## Key Features of LibSQL

### ✅ 100% SQLite Compatibility

You can use your existing SQLite codebase and switch to LibSQL. It supports:

- Same SQL syntax
- Same file format
- Same embedded behavior

No rewrite required.

---

### 🌐 Remote Access via WebSockets & HTTP

LibSQL supports **remote execution of SQL** over network protocols like:

- WebSockets
- HTTP(S)

This makes it perfect for:

- Edge applications
- Browser-based apps
- Syncing mobile devices to cloud storage

---

### 🔁 Replication & Distributed Writes

Unlike SQLite, LibSQL allows:

- **Multi-region write support**
- **Eventual consistency**
- **Data sync between edge and central server**

Example: You can write to a local LibSQL instance offline, and sync it to a cloud Turso database later.

---

### ☁️ Turso Integration

Turso is the official **Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)** built on LibSQL.

Benefits include:

- Hosting LibSQL on the **edge**
- Built-in replication
- Authentication and access control
- CLI and SDK tools

Turso is currently available in multiple regions across:

- **North America** (US, Canada)
- **Europe** (Germany, France, UK)
- **MENA** (UAE, Saudi Arabia)
- **South Asia** (India, Pakistan)

This makes it **GEO-optimized** for global applications.

---

### 🛠️ Embedded or Remote, You Choose

Use LibSQL in two ways:

1. **Embedded** (like SQLite):

```bash
libsql my-database.db
```

2. Remote (using SDK):

```bash
const client = createClient({
    url: "libsql://my-app.turso.io",
    authToken: "your_turso_token"
});
```

const result = await client.execute("SELECT \* FROM users;");

LibSQL vs SQLite: What’s the Difference?

| Feature                    | SQLite  | LibSQL | Notes            |
| :------------------------- | :-----: | :----: | :--------------- |
| Embedded Support           |   ✅    |   ✅   |                  |
| Remote DB Access           |   ❌    |   ✅   | (HTTP/WebSocket) |
| Replication                |   ❌    |   ✅   |                  |
| Distributed Writes         |   ❌    |   ✅   |                  |
| Cloud Hosting              |   ❌    |   ✅   | (via Turso)      |
| Open Source Fork           |   ✅    |   ✅   |                  |
| Serverless & Edge-Friendly |   ❌    |   ✅   |                  |
| WASM/WebAssembly Support   | Partial |  Full  |                  |

In short:
SQLite is perfect for local-only use.
LibSQL is SQLite + cloud + edge + sync.

When Should You Use LibSQL?

Use LibSQL if:

- You’re building a serverless or edge app (e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare Workers)
- You want local-first apps with cloud sync
- You need multi-region deployments with low latency
- You’re building a PWA, mobile app, or offline-first tool

Real-World Examples:

- eCommerce app syncing inventory between warehouses and online stores
- Health tracking app syncing offline data from remote clinics
- IoT platform where edge devices write data locally then sync to cloud

---

Getting Started with LibSQL

Step 1: Install LibSQL CLI

```bash
npm install -g @libsql/cli
```

Or download it from GitHub:
https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql

---

Step 2: Try It Locally

```bash
libsql test.db
```

Same as SQLite.

---

Step 3: Connect to a Remote DB (Turso) 1. Sign up at turso.tech 2. Create a database:

```bash
turso db create mydb --region fra
```

3. Use SDK to connect from your app:

```javascript
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client/web";

const client = createClient({
  url: "libsql://mydb-username.turso.io",
  authToken: "YOUR_TOKEN",
});
```
