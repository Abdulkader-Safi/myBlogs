# Next.js Middleware: A Developer‚Äôs Guide with Real Use Cases and Code Examples

Next.js has become the go-to React framework for building production-grade web applications. With features like file-based routing, API routes, and server-side rendering, it offers developers speed and flexibility. But one feature often underutilized (or misunderstood) is Next.js Middleware.

Middleware enables powerful edge logic that executes before a request is completed‚Äîallowing developers to intercept, modify, or redirect requests in near real-time. In this article, we‚Äôll explore what Next.js Middleware is, when to use it, and walk through concrete code examples and real-world use cases.

---

## What is Next.js Middleware?

Middleware in Next.js is a function that runs before a request is processed by your app‚Äôs routes or APIs. It lives at the edge layer, meaning closer to the user, reducing latency and allowing for smarter request handling.

### Key characteristics:

- Runs on the Edge Runtime (based on V8, not Node.js).
- Executes before rendering or API logic.
- Can rewrite, redirect, modify headers, or return responses.
- Runs in a stateless, lightweight environment, making it blazing fast.

File location:

```bash
/middleware.ts  # or middleware.js
```

Example boilerplate:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Example: Block access to /admin if not logged in
  if (
    !request.cookies.get("auth-token") &&
    request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/admin")
  ) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## Why Use Middleware?

Think of Middleware as your bouncer at the door‚Äîit decides what happens before the request enters your app. Some common scenarios:

1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Protect private routes.
   - Redirect unauthenticated users to login.
2. A/B Testing & Personalization
   - Show different experiences to users based on cookies, headers, or geolocation.
3. Localization
   - Detect user‚Äôs region or language and redirect accordingly.
4. Bot Detection & Rate Limiting
   - Block suspicious requests early.
5. Analytics & Logging
   - Capture request metadata without touching route logic.

## Practical Use Cases with Code

### 1. Protecting Routes with Authentication

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = request.cookies.get("token");

  if (!token && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

üëâ Useful for dashboards, admin panels, or member-only content.

### 2. Internationalization (i18n) Redirects

```typescript
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;
  const locale = request.headers.get("accept-language")?.split(",")[0] || "en";

  if (pathname === "/") {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/${locale}`, request.url));
  }
}
```

üëâ Detects browser language and redirects to localized content (/en, /fr, etc.).

### 3. A/B Testing or Feature Flags

```typescript
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? "A" : "B";

  if (group === "A") {
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/experiment/a", request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/experiment/b", request.url));
}
```

üëâ Split traffic dynamically at the edge without complex setup.

### 4. Blocking Bots and Bad Actors

```typescript
const blockedAgents = ["curl", "python", "scrapy"];

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const ua = request.headers.get("user-agent")?.toLowerCase() || "";

  if (blockedAgents.some((agent) => ua.includes(agent))) {
    return new Response("Blocked", { status: 403 });
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

üëâ Prevent scrapers or unwanted crawlers from hammering your app.

## Performance Considerations

- Runs at the Edge: Middleware is executed globally at CDN-level, so it‚Äôs fast.
- Stateless: No fs, crypto, or Node.js APIs. Use Web APIs only.
- Bundle Size Matters: Keep middleware lightweight‚Äîavoid large dependencies.
- Chaining Middleware: You can conditionally run multiple checks, but ensure minimal overhead.

---

## Best Practices

- Place logic only where needed‚Äîdon‚Äôt run heavy computation.
- Combine middleware with cookies or headers for personalization.
- Use NextResponse.rewrite for internal rewrites and NextResponse.redirect for external navigation.
- Always have a fallback path to avoid infinite loops.

---

## SEO Benefits of Middleware

Middleware indirectly helps SEO by:

- Improving page load speed (early redirects reduce TTFB).
- Supporting localized content (serving language-specific pages).
- Enforcing canonical routes (redirect duplicates).
- Blocking spam/bots, protecting crawl budget.

---

## Conclusion

Next.js Middleware is more than just a request filter‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful edge tool that lets developers build secure, performant, and personalized apps without bloating client or server logic.

Whether you‚Äôre handling authentication, localization, A/B testing, or bot protection, Middleware should be in your Next.js toolbox.

With great power comes great responsibility: keep your middleware fast, simple, and focused.
