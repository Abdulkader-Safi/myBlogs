# ClarifAI: Free AI-Powered Code Analysis for Visual Studio Code

## Understand Your Code Better with Local AI - No Cloud Required

As a developer, I've always struggled with understanding complex codebases, especially when jumping into unfamiliar projects or revisiting old code. That's why I built **ClarifAI** - a free, privacy-focused Visual Studio Code extension that uses local AI models to explain code and suggest improvements, all running on your own machine.

## What is ClarifAI?

ClarifAI (yes, the pun is intentional!) is a VS Code extension that brings the power of AI code analysis directly into your IDE. Unlike cloud-based AI coding assistants that send your code to external servers, ClarifAI runs completely locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai), ensuring your proprietary code never leaves your computer.

### Key Features

- **Instant Code Explanations**: Select any code snippet and get detailed explanations in plain English
- **Smart Enhancement Suggestions**: Receive AI-powered recommendations to improve code quality, performance, maintainability, and readability
- **100% Local & Private**: Your code stays on your machine - no cloud uploads, no privacy concerns
- **Real-time Streaming**: Get instant feedback as the AI generates responses
- **Beautiful Interface**: Clean, intuitive sidebar panel with markdown rendering and syntax highlighting
- **Universal Language Support**: Works with any programming language VS Code supports
- **Completely Free**: No subscriptions, no API costs, no hidden fees

## Why I Built ClarifAI

This is my first VS Code extension, and I created it to solve a real problem I faced daily: understanding what code actually does without spending hours tracing through logic. Whether it's legacy code, unfamiliar frameworks, or even my own code from six months ago, having an AI assistant that can explain and suggest improvements has been a game-changer.

## How to Use ClarifAI

Using ClarifAI is incredibly simple. Here's a quick walkthrough:

### 1. Installation & Setup

First, you need to install two things:

1. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) - this is the local AI runtime that powers ClarifAI
2. **Download an AI model**. I recommend starting with `deepseek-coder` - it's only 800MB, fast, and excellent at explaining code:

   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-coder
   ```

   Other great models for code analysis:

   - `codellama` - Meta's specialized code model
   - `phind-codellama` - Fine-tuned for coding tasks
   - `mistral` - Great all-around model with solid code capabilities

3. **Install ClarifAI** from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace (search for "ClarifAI" or "clarif-ai")

### 2. Analyzing Your Code

Once installed, here's how to use ClarifAI:

1. **Open any code file** in VS Code (JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust - anything works!)
2. **Select the code** you want to analyze - it can be a single function, a class, or an entire file
3. **Click the ClarifAI icon** in the left sidebar to open the panel
4. **Choose your AI model** from the dropdown (e.g., `deepseek-coder`)
5. **Select the analysis mode**:

   - **Explain Code**: Get a detailed breakdown of what the code does
   - **Suggest Enhancements**: Get recommendations for improvements

6. **Click "Analyze Selected Code"** and watch as the AI streams its analysis in real-time

### Example: Analyzing an HTTP Contact Form

Let me show you a real example. Say you have an HTTP endpoint that handles contact form submissions. You're reviewing it for security and want to understand exactly what it does:

1. Select the entire function or route handler
2. Choose the "Explain Code" mode
3. Click Analyze

ClarifAI will provide:

- A high-level summary of what the code does
- Explanation of each function and its purpose
- Details about data flow and dependencies
- Potential security considerations

Then, switch to "Suggest Enhancements" mode and analyze the same code again. ClarifAI might suggest:

- Input validation improvements
- Better error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements like rate limiting or sanitization
- Code readability improvements

## Why ClarifAI Stands Out

### Privacy First

Unlike GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or other cloud-based AI coding tools, ClarifAI runs entirely on your local machine. Your proprietary code, trade secrets, and sensitive logic never leave your computer.

### No Subscription Fees

No monthly costs, no API tokens, no usage limits. Once you have Ollama installed, ClarifAI is completely free forever.

### Flexible Model Selection

You're not locked into a single AI model. Choose from dozens of open-source models optimized for different tasks, or use smaller models on less powerful hardware.

### Works Offline

No internet connection? No problem. ClarifAI works perfectly offline since everything runs locally.

### Beginner Friendly

Whether you're a junior developer trying to understand a senior's code, or an experienced developer exploring a new codebase, ClarifAI makes code comprehension accessible.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Code Reviews

Before reviewing a pull request, use ClarifAI to understand the changes quickly and identify potential issues.

### 2. Legacy Code Exploration

Working with a 10-year-old codebase with no documentation? ClarifAI can explain what each module does.

### 3. Learning New Languages

Picking up Rust or Go? Analyze example code to understand language-specific patterns and idioms.

### 4. Security Audits

Use the enhancement suggestions to identify potential security vulnerabilities in authentication, data handling, or API endpoints.

### 5. Refactoring Guidance

Get suggestions on how to improve code structure, reduce complexity, and follow best practices.

### 6. Documentation Assistance

Understand complex algorithms or business logic before documenting them.

## What's Coming Next

I'm actively developing ClarifAI and have exciting features planned:

### Prompt Generation for AI Coding Assistants

One feature I'm particularly excited about is **automatic prompt generation**. ClarifAI will analyze your code and generate optimized prompts you can use with your favorite AI coding assistant - whether that's Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other tool.

Imagine selecting buggy code, clicking a button, and getting a perfectly formatted prompt that you can paste into your AI assistant:

> "This TypeScript function handles user authentication but has a race condition in the token refresh logic. Refactor it to use proper async/await patterns and add error handling for network failures."

### Other Planned Features

- **Analysis History**: Keep track of previous analyses and refer back to them
- **Custom Prompts**: Create your own analysis modes tailored to your workflow
- **Batch Analysis**: Analyze multiple files or entire directories at once
- **Debugging Mode**: Specialized analysis for bug hunting and troubleshooting
- **Performance Profiling Suggestions**: Get optimization recommendations based on code patterns
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate code comments and docs

## Technical Details

### Built With

- **TypeScript**: Core extension logic
- **VS Code Extension API**: Native integration with VS Code
- **Ollama API**: Local AI model inference
- **Webview API**: Custom sidebar panel with rich UI

### How It Works

ClarifAI uses the VS Code Extension API to capture your code selection, then sends it to Ollama running locally on your machine. The AI model processes the code and streams the response back, which is rendered in a beautiful markdown format with syntax highlighting.

### Performance

Thanks to streaming responses and efficient local processing, ClarifAI provides near-instant feedback. Smaller models like `deepseek-coder` can analyze typical functions in under 2 seconds on modern hardware.

## Installation Guide

## Tips & Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Model

- **For speed**: Use `deepseek-coder` (800MB) - perfect for quick explanations
- **For detail**: Use `codellama:13b` - more thorough but slower
- **For general code**: Use `mistral` - good all-rounder

### Getting Better Results

1. **Select relevant code**: Don't analyze entire files unless necessary
2. **Be specific**: Analyze functions or logical blocks for clearer explanations
3. **Use both modes**: First explain code, then get enhancement suggestions
4. **Experiment with models**: Different models have different strengths

### Performance Tips

- Keep Ollama running in the background to avoid startup delays
- Use smaller models on laptops or machines with limited RAM
- Close other heavy applications when running larger models
