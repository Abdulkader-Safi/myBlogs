# Razor vs Blazor in .NET: What's the Difference?

If you're building web applications with .NET, you've likely come across two names: **Razor** and **Blazor**. While they sound similar, they serve different purposes.

In this guide, you'll learn the **key differences between Razor and Blazor**, when to use each, and how they relate in the .NET ecosystem.

---

## What Is Razor?

**Razor** is a server-side markup syntax used in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. It lets you write HTML and C# in the same file.

### Key Features:

- Uses `.cshtml` files
- Executes on the **server**
- Great for SEO and fast page loads
- Ideal for multi-page applications
- Requires full-page reloads for updates

### Common Use Case:

You're building a traditional website where content is rendered on the server and sent to the client as static HTML.

## What Is Blazor?

**Blazor** is a modern UI framework for building **interactive web applications** using C# instead of JavaScript.

### Key Features:

- Uses `.razor` files (component-based)
- Can run in the **browser** (Blazor WebAssembly) or on the **server** (Blazor Server)
- Enables real-time interactivity without JavaScript
- Supports Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Built on top of Razor syntax

### Common Use Case:

You‚Äôre building a dynamic front-end app that needs real-time updates, fast interactions, and rich UI‚Äîwithout writing JavaScript.

## Razor vs Blazor: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature            | Razor Pages         | Blazor                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Rendering          | Server-side         | Server-side or Client-side (WASM) |
| Syntax             | Razor (.cshtml)     | Razor (.razor components)         |
| Page Updates       | Full reload         | Real-time UI updates              |
| Interactivity      | Limited (via JS)    | High (via C# components)          |
| SEO Support        | Excellent           | Depends on hosting model          |
| JS Dependency      | Yes (for rich UI)   | Optional                          |
| App Type           | Multi-page web apps | SPA or hybrid apps                |
| Component-based UI | No                  | Yes                               |

## When Should You Use Razor?

Use Razor when you:

- Need **fast server-side rendering**
- Care about **SEO and accessibility**
- Are building **multi-page apps**
- Want to avoid complex front-end logic

### Example Scenarios:

- Company websites
- Content-heavy blogs
- Simple CRUD admin panels

---

## When Should You Use Blazor?

Use Blazor when you:

- Want to build **interactive UIs**
- Prefer using **C# over JavaScript**
- Need a **SPA-like experience**
- Plan to reuse **UI components**

### Example Scenarios:

- Internal dashboards
- E-commerce apps with dynamic filters
- Real-time collaboration tools

---

## Developer Insights

Many developers transitioning from JavaScript frameworks (like React or Angular) enjoy Blazor for its:

- Component model
- Type safety with C#
- Ease of integration in .NET backends

However, **Blazor Server** can struggle on poor connections due to its reliance on SignalR, while **Blazor WebAssembly** has larger initial payloads but runs entirely in the browser.

---

## Razor and Blazor: How They Work Together

Blazor actually **uses Razor syntax** under the hood. Here's the difference:

- **Razor** = templating engine
- **Blazor** = UI framework using Razor for components

So they‚Äôre not opposites‚Äîthey‚Äôre part of the same ecosystem.

---

## Conclusion

Choosing between Razor and Blazor depends on what you're building:

- Choose **Razor Pages** if you want simplicity, server-side rendering, and SEO.
- Choose **Blazor** if you need interactivity, modern SPA capabilities, and component-based UI‚Äîall using C#.

Both are powerful. The best choice? Depends on your project goals.
