2. Run `claude` to start an interactive session
3. Let Claude explore your codebase with: "What does this project do?"

---

## Essential Best Practices for Maximum Productivity

### 1. Start with Project Context

**❌ Don't do this:**

```text
"Fix the login bug"
```

**✅ Do this instead:**

```text
"I'm getting authentication errors in our React app. The login component is throwing a 401 error even with valid credentials. Can you investigate the authentication flow and identify what's wrong?"
```

**Why this works:** Claude Code performs better with specific context and clear problem definitions.

### 2. Use Progressive Refinement

Break complex tasks into digestible steps:

**Step 1:** Broad exploration

```text
"Analyze our current API architecture and identify potential scalability issues"
```

**Step 2:** Focused investigation

```text
"Focus on the database queries in the user service - are there any N+1 query problems?"
```

**Step 3:** Specific implementation

```text
"Implement query optimization for the getUserPosts endpoint using eager loading"
```

### 3. Leverage File and Directory References

Use the `@` symbol for precise file targeting:

```text
"Review @src/components/LoginForm.tsx and @src/utils/auth.ts for security vulnerabilities"
```

**Multiple file analysis:**

```text
"Compare the authentication logic between @frontend/auth.js and @backend/middleware/auth.js - are they consistent?"
```

---

## Advanced Claude Code Workflows

### Extended Thinking for Complex Problems

Trigger deeper analysis with specific prompts:

**For Architecture Decisions:**

```text
"I need to choose between GraphQL and REST for our new API. Think through the pros and cons considering our team size, existing tech stack, and future scalability needs. Keep thinking about the long-term maintenance implications."
```

**For Debugging Complex Issues:**

```text
"Our application is experiencing memory leaks in production. Analyze the entire codebase and think through potential causes. Consider event listeners, closures, and third-party library usage. Think more about the patterns you're seeing."
```

**Recognition Patterns:**

- Claude displays thinking as italic gray text
- Trigger with phrases like "keep thinking," "think more," or "consider all angles"
- Best for architectural decisions, complex debugging, and feature planning

### Image Analysis for Visual Context

Claude Code can analyze screenshots, diagrams, and UI mockups:

**UI Implementation:**

```text
"Here's a Figma design [drag and drop image]. Implement this component using React and Tailwind CSS, matching the exact styling and responsive behavior."
```

**Bug Analysis:**

```text
"This is a screenshot of the error I'm seeing [paste image]. What's causing this layout issue and how can I fix it?"
```

**Architecture Planning:**

```text
"Review this system architecture diagram [attach image]. Suggest improvements for better scalability and identify potential bottlenecks."
```

### Conversation Resume and Context Management

**Resume Recent Work:**

```bash
claude --continue
```

**Select from Past Sessions:**

```bash
claude --resume
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use `--continue` for picking up where you left off
- Use `--resume` when you need to reference specific past conversations
- Claude maintains full conversation history and project context
- Particularly powerful for multi-day feature development

## Configuration and Customization Mastery

### Settings Hierarchy

Claude Code uses a hierarchical configuration system:

1. **Enterprise managed policies** (highest priority)
2. **User settings:** `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. **Project shared settings:** `.claude/settings.json`
4. **Project local settings:** `.claude/settings.local.json` (lowest priority)

### Essential Configuration Commands

```bash
# List all current settings
claude config list

# Get specific setting value
claude config get model

# Set configuration value
claude config set model claude-3-sonnet
```

### Key Environment Variables

```bash
# API authentication
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Control output size
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=8192

# Opt out of telemetry
export DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

### Custom Subagent Configuration

Create specialized agents for specific tasks:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "security-reviewer": {
      "description": "Reviews code for security vulnerabilities",
      "tools": ["grep", "read", "analyze"]
    },
    "performance-optimizer": {
      "description": "Optimizes code for better performance",
      "tools": ["profile", "benchmark", "refactor"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Plan Mode: Safe Codebase Exploration

For read-only analysis and planning:

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

**Perfect for:**

- Exploring unfamiliar codebases
- Architectural planning without accidental changes
- Code reviews and analysis
- Onboarding new team members

**Plan Mode Features:**

- No file modifications
- Safe codebase exploration

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Mistake 1: Vague Problem Descriptions

**Wrong:** "My code doesn't work"

**Right:** "The user authentication is failing with a 401 error on POST /api/login, even though I'm sending the correct email and password in the request body"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Providing Enough Context

**Wrong:** "Add a new feature"

**Right:** "Add a user profile editing feature to our React app. Users should be able to update their name, email, and avatar. Use our existing form validation patterns and API structure"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring Project Structure

**Wrong:** Working in isolation without understanding the codebase

**Right:** Start with "Explain the project structure and main components" before making changes

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Using Git Integration

**Wrong:** Making changes without version control

**Right:** Let Claude Code create meaningful commits with proper messages

### ❌ Mistake 5: Overwhelming with Too Many Tasks

**Wrong:** "Fix all the bugs, add new features, and refactor the entire codebase"

**Right:** Break into specific, actionable tasks and tackle them progressively
