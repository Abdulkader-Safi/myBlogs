## What is Claude Code? Why It‚Äôs a Game-Changer

Claude Code isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust another AI chatbot.‚Äù It‚Äôs an agentic AI development tool that edits files, commits changes, navigates codebases, and automates repetitive tasks‚Äîall while respecting your workflow.

Think of it as an AI-powered pair programmer that never tires and always understands your project.

### Core Advantages of Claude Code

- Terminal-native: No context switching. Stay in your CLI.
- Direct action: Edit files, run commands, and create commits automatically.
- Context-aware: Works across your entire codebase, not just single snippets.
- Composable: Integrates with Git, CI/CD pipelines, and dev tools.
- Enterprise-ready: Security, privacy, and collaboration built in.

Why Developers Prefer Claude Code 1. Speed: Ship features from plain English requirements. 2. Intelligence: Debug complex issues and assist with architectural choices. 3. Integration: Native support for GitHub, Git, and CI/CD workflows. 4. Flexibility: Works for bug fixes, performance tuning, and full-scale features.

## Getting Started with Claude Code

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ ‚Üí node --version
- Claude.ai or Anthropic Console account
- Git for version control

### Installation

#### Option 1 ‚Äì NPM (Recommended):

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

#### Option 2 ‚Äì Native Installers

Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows from Anthropic docs.

Authenticate

```bash
claude
# or
claude /login
```

#### First-Time Setup

1. Navigate to your project directory
2. Run claude for an interactive session
3. Start with:

```txt
"What does this project do?"
```

---

## Best Practices for Productivity

### 1. Provide Rich Context

‚ùå Wrong: "Fix the login bug"
‚úÖ Right:

```txt
"I'm getting 401 errors in our React app login flow. Even with valid credentials, authentication fails. Investigate @src/components/LoginForm.tsx and @src/utils/auth.ts"
```

**Why**: Claude Code thrives on context-rich problem statements.

### 2. Use Progressive Refinement

Break tasks into steps:

- **Step 1 ‚Äì Broad**: "Analyze our API architecture for scalability issues"
- **Step 2 ‚Äì Narrow**: "Focus on N+1 query problems in the user service"
- **Step 3 ‚Äì Implement**: "Optimize getUserPosts with eager loading"

### 3. Reference Files & Directories

Use @ for precision:

```txt
"Review @src/components/LoginForm.tsx and @src/utils/auth.ts for security issues"
```

Compare cross-files:

```txt
"Compare @frontend/auth.js and @backend/middleware/auth.js for consistency"
```

## Advanced Workflows with Claude Code

### Extended Thinking Mode

For deep analysis, use prompts like ‚Äúthink more‚Äù or ‚Äúkeep thinking.‚Äù

### Example ‚Äì Architecture Decisions

```txt
"Choose between GraphQL vs REST for our new API. Think through pros/cons considering scalability, team size, and maintenance."
```

### Example ‚Äì Debugging

```txt
"We‚Äôre seeing memory leaks. Analyze closures, event listeners, and library usage across the codebase."
```

## Image Analysis

- UI Build: Attach mockups ‚Üí **"Implement this Figma design in React + Tailwind"**
- Bug Debugging: Paste screenshots ‚Üí **"What‚Äôs causing this layout issue?"**
- System Design: **"Review this architecture diagram and suggest scalability improvements"**

---

## Resuming Work

- Continue last session ‚Üí **claude --continue**
- Resume from past ‚Üí **claude --resume**

---

## Configuration & Customization

Settings Hierarchy

1. Enterprise policies
2. User settings ‚Üí **~/.claude/settings.json**
3. Project shared ‚Üí **.claude/settings.json**
4. Local project ‚Üí **.claude/settings.local.json**

Commands

```bash
claude config list
claude config get model
claude config set model claude-3-sonnet
```

Env Variables

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=8192
export DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

Subagents Example

```json
"subagents": {
  "security-reviewer": {
    "tools": ["grep","read","analyze"]
  },
  "performance-optimizer": {
    "tools": ["profile","benchmark","refactor"]
  }
}
```
