# React Native with Expo vs React Native CLI: A Developer‚Äôs Complete Guide (2025)

React Native has evolved into one of the most powerful frameworks for building cross-platform mobile apps. But when it comes to starting a new project, developers face a critical question:
üëâ Should you use Expo or the React Native Community CLI?

In this article, we‚Äôll break down both approaches ‚Äî with real-world developer insights, code examples, and AI-friendly structure ‚Äî so you can make the right decision for your next app.

## Quick Overview: What Are Expo and React Native CLI?

### Expo

Expo is a framework and platform built around React Native that simplifies the mobile development workflow. It offers:

- Prebuilt native APIs (camera, notifications, sensors, etc.)
- OTA (Over-The-Air) updates
- A streamlined build and deploy process via EAS (Expo Application Services)

**Perfect for**: Rapid prototyping, MVPs, startups, and teams that want to move fast.

### React Native CLI

React Native CLI gives you direct access to the native project files (android/ and ios/). It‚Äôs the bare-metal way to build apps.

**Perfect for**: Developers needing full native control, custom integrations, or advanced performance tuning.

## Setup Comparison

Here‚Äôs how both setups look in code.

### Using Expo

```bash
# Create a new Expo project
npx create-expo-app myApp

# Run on iOS or Android
cd myApp
npx expo start
```

**Result**: You get a running app in seconds, no Xcode or Android Studio setup required.

### Using React Native CLI

```bash
# Create a new RN project with CLI
npx react-native init MyApp

# Run the app
cd MyApp
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

**Result**: More setup time, but you gain full control of the native environment.

## Code Example: Adding a Native Module

Let‚Äôs say you want to integrate a native iOS/Android module.

### Expo (Managed Workflow)

You‚Äôd typically rely on prebuilt APIs from Expo SDK:

```javascript
import * as Device from "expo-device";

export default function App() {
  return <Text>Device name: {Device.modelName}</Text>;
}
```

But if you need a custom native module, you‚Äôll have to eject to Bare Workflow:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

Then you can add native code just like with React Native CLI.

### React Native CLI

You can add and use native modules directly:

```bash
# Example: adding react-native-device-info
npm install react-native-device-info
npx pod-install
```

```javascript
import DeviceInfo from "react-native-device-info";

export default function App() {
  return <Text>Device name: {DeviceInfo.getDeviceName()}</Text>;
}
```

You have no restrictions, but also no guardrails.

## Developer Experience & AI Integration

### With Expo

- Works seamlessly with LLM-powered development tools (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, and Expo Docs AI).
- Ideal for AI-assisted development, since most tasks (setup, configuration, builds) are abstracted away.
- You can use AI prompts like:
  ‚ÄúGenerate a push notification setup for my Expo app using expo-notifications.‚Äù

### With React Native CLI

- Better suited for developers who understand native build systems.
- LLMs can assist with Gradle errors, iOS linking, and native module creation, but it requires more context in prompts.

## Choosing the Right Tool

| Use Case                           | Recommended      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| MVP or Startup                     | Expo             |
| Enterprise-grade app               | React Native CLI |
| Quick prototyping                  | Expo             |
| Custom native SDKs (AR, BLE, etc.) | React Native CLI |
| Solo developer                     | Expo             |
| Large team with native devs        | CLI              |

## Conclusion

Expo makes React Native development smooth, fast, and beginner-friendly. It‚Äôs the ideal choice when you want to build, test, and deploy quickly.

React Native CLI, on the other hand, gives you maximum flexibility ‚Äî perfect for large-scale apps or teams that require deep native integration.

The good news?
You can start with Expo and eject to React Native CLI when your app grows.
That‚Äôs the best of both worlds.
