# Trying Vibe Coding for the First Time with Claude Code: I Built an Invoice Generator in One Day

I kept hearing about **vibe coding** all over the place.  
AI writing your code. Projects done faster.  
It sounded cool. Productive. Trendy.  
So I thought, _why not?_

I had a project idea I actually needed for myself: a custom invoice generator.  
Instead of writing it line by line, I tried something new:  
I gave the job to Claude Code and just _vibed_.

Here’s how it went.

## What Is Vibe Coding?

To me?  
Vibe coding is when you **tell the AI what to build**…  
…and just _watch it work_.

No endless boilerplate.  
No starting from scratch.  
You’re like the architect, and the AI is your builder.

## My Setup: One Day, One Idea, One AI

Here’s how I did it:

1. **I described the project to ChatGPT** — a full picture of what I wanted.
2. **ChatGPT turned that into a PRD** — clean, structured, easy to follow.
3. **I gave that PRD to Claude Code** — and told it to generate the full project.
4. **Claude Code started coding** — backend, frontend, everything.

And then… I vibed. Just me and the AI.  
Coffee in hand. Watching code appear. Fixing. Tweaking. Guiding.

## The Final Product: My Invoice Generator

Here’s what Claude and I built:

- **User authentication** (admin + normal users)
- **Only admins can create users**
- **Admins set invoice limits for each user**
- **Each user sees only their own invoices**
- **You can create, view, edit, preview, and download invoices as PDF**
- **5 ready-made invoice templates**
- **Custom invoice builder** — design your own template using HTML, CSS, and a custom templating language
- **SMTP configuration** — send emails with a message + PDF invoice attached

The coolest part?  
You don’t just use the templates…  
You can **create your own invoice design from scratch.**

I even made it so that I can email the invoice directly, clean and professional.

## So… Was It Easy?

Not gonna lie, **not fully**.  
At first, I asked Claude to use Laravel 12.  
It ignored me and went with Laravel 11 and Breeze.  
That was annoying.

And because I’m not a master in prompt engineering (yet),  
It took me a bit to get the hang of it.  
Around **6 to 10 hours** in total.

But still…  
I didn’t write most of the code.  
Claude did.

## What I Learned

- Claude Code is powerful. But you need to **guide it like a team member.**
- Writing a good prompt is like writing a good task brief.
- If you’re not clear, it’ll guess. Sometimes wrong.
- When you _are_ clear? Magic.

## Would I Use It Again?

Absolutely.  
I just need to get better at **prompting for code.**

I already know my next project.  
But this one? I picked it on purpose.  
I’ll actually use this **invoice generator for myself**, and share it with a few friends too.

## Final Thoughts

This was my first time trying vibe coding.  
And while it wasn't _perfect_, it was definitely **worth it**.

I didn’t just save time.  
I built something real. Useful. For me.

The future of development?  
It might just be you, your idea… and your AI.

And that’s a vibe I’m ready for.
