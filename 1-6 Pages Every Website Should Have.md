### **1. Homepage**

**What it is:** The homepage is the first page visitors see when they land on your website. It serves as a gateway to all other content and should clearly communicate the purpose of your site.  
**What it’s used for:** To introduce your brand, highlight key services/products, and guide users to other important sections of the site.

### **2. About Page**

**What it is:** The About page introduces your business, team, or personal brand and explains what you do. It humanizes your website by sharing your story.  
**What it’s used for:** To build trust, showcase your expertise, and explain why your audience should care about your services or content.  
**Why it’s important:** Visitors want to know who you are and what motivates you before they engage with your offerings. A well-crafted About page reduces uncertainty and builds credibility, especially for new audiences or potential clients.  
**What is the most important content this page should have:**
