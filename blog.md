## 8. Red Flags in Software Pricing: How to Spot Problems Early

### Pricing Red Flags

**Red Flag #1: Estimates Without Questions**

If a contractor gives you a price without asking detailed questions, run.

**What Should Happen:**

- 1-2 hour discovery call minimum
- Detailed questionnaire
- Requirements clarification
- Technical constraints discussion
- Timeline expectations review

**Red Flag #2: Prices Too Good to Be True**

If a quote is 50%+ below market rate, there's a reason.

**Common Reasons:**

- Inexperienced developer
- Offshore team with communication issues
- Scope misunderstanding
- Low-quality deliverables
- Hidden fees later

**Red Flag #3: Vague Scope Definition**

"We'll build you a custom e-commerce platform for \$15,000" without specifics.

**Proper Scope Includes:**

- Specific feature list
- Technology stack
- Deliverables
- Timeline
- What's NOT included
- Assumptions

**Red Flag #4: No Contract or Weak Contract**

Professional contractors use detailed contracts with:

- Scope of work
- Payment terms
- Timeline
- Intellectual property rights
- Termination clauses
- Dispute resolution

**Red Flag #5: 100% Upfront Payment**

**Standard Payment Structure:**

- Deposit: 20-30%
- Milestone payments: 50-60%
- Final payment: 10-20%

**Never pay 100% upfront** unless working with established agency with strong reputation.

**Red Flag #6: No Testing or QA Mentioned**
